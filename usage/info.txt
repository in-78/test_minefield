Usage:
  ruby main.rb [input_filename.txt] [output_filename.txt] - run main script

    where:
      input_filename.txt - filename of input data. 'input.txt' by default
      output_filename.txt - filename of output results. 'output.txt' by default

  ruby main.rb --help - show this help

  ****  Input data ****

    Input file should be text file and contains lines with information about mines (x, y, radius).
    Each line should contains 3 float or integer numbers separated by space (or spaces).
    Example: '1 1 2'


  ****  Output data ****

    Output file contans a table with details about each mine and its reaction.
    We can see explosions count, duration and details about each time interval.
    We sort all mines by rank calculating by formula:

      explosions / duration

    Assume that the mine in the top of the list triggers the most explosions in the fewest duration.
    If few mines have the same rank we sort them by number of explosions.
    If output file already exists, it will be overwritten.
